Steps for simulating on paper trading account (demo account)
Everytime on launching IB Workstation
1. Under File click Global Configuration
2. Select API -> Settings
3. Make sure Enable ActiveX and Socket Clients is checked
4. Make sure Read-Only API is unchecked
5. Make sure Socket port is set to 7497

A demo account works with the steps above, it just needs to be redone everytime on launch
With a pool account with IKBR Pro enabled, it may not need to be redone everytime
